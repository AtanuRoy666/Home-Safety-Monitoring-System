# Home-Safety-Monitoring-System
This is a simulation project done for the CSE360 Lab in Brac University. 

Expected Equipment:
Following components are used to build the system:
1.	Arduino Uno
2.	PIR Motion sensor
3.	Smoke sensor
4.	Buzzer
5.	L.C.D(16 X 2) (GPIO device)
6.	USB cable A to B
7.	Bluetooth Serial Module
8.	Mobile Phone (I/O device)

Home security has become a prime concern in recent years. As the technology is emerging every
second, abundant home based security systems have been developing and implementing with many modern features to keep the home safe.
We have designed an interesting and cheap home security system. This Gadget helps you to protect your house from thieves, fires etc. In this project we are going 
to use an Arduino Uno R3 Board, P.I.R Sensor module, Smoke Sensor module, LCD and some other components. Compact home security system can provide top notch security 
in different areas such as detection of unwanted presence and alarming everyone in case of danger etc. Arduino; functions almost as a small computer; will be 
connected with different sensors and GPIO devices in order to achieve our objectives. After building the compact security system, a user can keep track of what is 
happening in that particular area even when he is not close to that place. when a PIR motion sensor detects an unusual movement inside the home, it will provide 
essential information and transmit it to a smartphone using a web application. Despite of security breaches, if suddenly some unwanted disaster occurs such as fire, 
the smoke sensor will instantly detect it and will notify us via Bluetooth. Moreover, the smoke sensor will use an LCD to show a message whether everything is fine 
or not. The advantage of this system is that it covers different areas when it comes to security and it can be easily made using Arduino, sensors, GPIO devices 
and I/O devices.
